##
# Detailed descriptions of columns in this file:
#
# prim_db:	The name of the database (file name) that contains the primary motif.
# prim_id:	A name for the primary motif that is unique in the motif database file.
# prim_alt:	An alternate name of the primary motif that may be provided
#		in the motif database file.
# sec_db:	The name of the database (file name) that contains the secondary motif.
# sec_id:	A name for the motif that is unique in the motif database file.
# sec_alt:	An alternate name of the secondary motif that may be provided
#		in the motif database file.
# trim_left:	Number of positions trimmed from left of secondary motif
# trim_right:	Number of positions trimmed from right of secondary motif
# If the next three fields are not blank, the motif is redundant with a more significant ('parent') motif.
# red_db:	The database (file name) that contains the parent motif.
# red_id:	A name for the parent motif that is unique in the motif database file.
# red_alt:	An alternate name of the parent motif that may be provided
#		in the motif database file.
# E-value:	The expected number motifs that would have least one
#		spacing as enriched as the best spacing for this secondary.
#		The E-value is the best spacing p-value multiplied by the number of motifs in the
#		input database(s).
# gap:		The distance between the edge of the primary and the (trimmed) secondary motif.
# orient:	The (combination) of quadrants for which occurrences
#		of this spacing are combined.
# count:	The number of occurrences of the secondary motif with the
#		given spacing and orientation to the primary motif.
# total:	The total number of occurrences of the secondary motif within the
#		margins around the best primary motif occurrence.
# adj_p-value:	The p-value of the gap and orientation, adjusted for
#		nine combinations of quadrants times the number of gaps tested
#		(as controlled by the -range switch).
# p-value:	The p-value of the gap and orientation adjusted only for the number of gaps tested.
